# Computer Vision RPS
## Milestone 1 & 2
After setting up the environment by cloning the github repo onto my local machine, I used Teachable Machine to record several hundred images of three different 'classes': myself showing each of the different rock, paper and scissors signs.

Teachable machine then 'trains' to be able to distinguish between each in future images - and can use the webcam in real time to tell me which sign i am holding up.

This model was exported from Teachable Machine and saved in the cloned repo from before, as well as the labels for each class

No code written in these milestones.

## Milestone 3
Anaconda installed and used to create a virtual environment
